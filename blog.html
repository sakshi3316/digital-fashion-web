                    <span>The pioneer of digital fashion The Fabricant becomes exclusively available at Dress-X for the first time. Until recently, the Fabricant pieces were executed just for international brands like Puma, Off-White, Tommy Hilfiger, Marques Almeida, and A Bathing Ape, while their ‘Iridescence’ dress was sold for 9500$ at a charity auction. It considered to be the most expensive digital brand in the world. </span>

                        The Fabricant is a pioneer digital fashion house from Amsterdam operating at the intersection of technology, new business models, and fashion. As leaders in the field, we are taking the fashion industry towards a digital existence that is fundamental to the lives of its consumers. Before Dress-X, our digital clothes were only available for marketing purposes for big brands or for free downloading on our website. We see this as an important step to familiarise designers and consumers with 3D fashion design and hope to inspire people to begin exploring the world of digital-only fashion.

                <p>
                    <span>As we talked about producing the pieces to final customers, formerly to get dressed-up people had to use their skills in Clo3D or other programs. Now to try on our looks you just need to choose any garment at Dress-X, upload your original photo, and receive the pic with the attached look. </span>

                        Same difficulties as tailoring physical garments. It’s a craftsmanship where small details are of the essence. A digital tailor needs to have the same skillset as a traditional one. We speak mainly about drape, fit, and silhouette at The Fabricant, as well as small details like stitches, seams, trims, and materials. All of these need an innovative technological solution to automate these processes. Once our automated pipeline for garment visualisation is finalized we will be able to scale our client service operations as well as our own content creation.</span>

                        "How has Covid-19 pandemic affected the growth of the digital fashion industry? Have we made a big step towards the future?"

                        The pandemic collided with our mission in an abrupt but fortuitous way. The fashion industry woke up to this immediate need to digitize. Fashion is in a real state of flux, and this is a moment to instil practices that push for a digital-centric future that is smarter, more resilient, and less wasteful than before. Even if a complete digital overhaul means the end of physical fashion experiences, it doesn’t seem to be a negative thing as a 3D fashion show has no physical boundaries to creativity. It’s not a passive experience but an interactive sensorial narrative that lasts, and that can be accessed anytime, anywhere. This only touches on the presentation aspect of fashion and barely scratches the surface of what is possible in terms of sustainability and efficiency, if the industry embraces end-to-end tech solutions, such as designing clothes using 3D programs (instead of sketching them on paper).
